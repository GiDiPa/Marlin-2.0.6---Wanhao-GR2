# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware For Wanhao GR2

This is the original Marlin 2.0.x (2.0.6) that Wanhao passed to me. Actually it is more stable
when enabling feature than the newest stable releases. 

Being a proprietary Board (based on STM32F103VET6 Chip), when I try to move to newest releases, I get 
small errors and I fix them with few tricks. They are functional, but if you want to test something 
different use this repo to compile your own firmware.
